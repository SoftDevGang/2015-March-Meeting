These notes were taken in the interval 23-24 March 2015.
This meeting took place in Vienna at Sektor5 co-working place.
Attendees:

Usable Software Design

Why: narrow, increase confort, increase self-confidence, reduce annoyance of users, reduce fear, stabilize faster, avoid being lost, reduce insecurity, reduce uncertainty

Topic: Good Navigation / Structure
Expected outcome: a list of things to do that improve the navigation / structure of the code so that the needs are improved.


Retrospective 1st Day:

Johan: Let's talk also about how to talk to the gut feeling and passion of the people. Explore ways of people evaluated what happened. Let's spend a bit more time on how to make really simple things that can be used tomorrow to create usable software design.

Peter: I was aware we had the constraints, we didn't have to find about IDEs, but we did. We should do something real, try doing some code as well.

Hans: I am a little bit suprised about the tools because I had really bad experiences with tools when they get some findings. I am a little bit careful about tools. Also I thought here there could be some options to create useful tools, even if I feel it could be the wrong way. 

Erik: Everything was very practical. There were new idea, almost all on tooling level because we all know what are the toolings and practices we can combine. I would like the results we have not to be at a high level, looking back 15 years from now I would like to see that it changed something. The small everyday things, especially visualising, help most people and visualisation is most about tooling.

Alex: I would like to have a way to restrict the programmers to be able to write the code in a good place. We are talking about DDD, good naming, tests, etc but they are at a basic level. We need to go to a higher level that helps the developers do a task in a natural way.

Adi: I would like to structure all the things we did (the three groups) in a less scattered way. We could use this structured view later to focus on the next step.



Retrospective first day

Peter: Again my expectations were not met, which is not necessarily bad. We had great discussions, maybe too much discussions. I would like to do some coding. 
Great discussions. We did some code review, it's almost like coding.

Hans: I liked the feedback on my code, I was surprised and it was very nice. I don't know if my expectations were met or not. We should think always about the constraints we had (only design, not Ide, tests, tools) maybe. It was nice and very interesting.

Erik: What I liked about it today, getting it on the same level, focusing on usable design. I feel we are lacking the facilitator. We opened up, we explored by opening up more and then we explored more. Then we forgot to close it to each other, we do not know what the rest are doing. I am not convinced that these constraints are valid anymore, not necessarily on the opening phase. I have no clue what we will do tomorrow. 
One thing we do now, is that we want to do something different than an Open Space, but I don't feel the difference from Open Space. 
A thing I would do to improve: instead of trying to come up with new things, try to link existing things better. We expanded on an existing idea, but it feels like what we did was scratching the surface, building an change request for Jet Brains.

Johan: I appreaciate having seen your code (Alex), I would like tomorrow someone to see the code I worked on. I would like to have my code torn appart, while focusing on software design.
Always when you improve something, you make some other parts worse. The ideas we came-up today are valuable to me. 
I am concerned that my coleagues are no interested in what we are doing now. I would like to find a bit of time during the evening about this. Maybe my expectation are not high enough. 

Alex: Comming-up with a structure for a domain that is completely new is very hard. You never know what you get into. It's impossible to estimate. 
I think we got to a place where the things we found are very useful, we related what happens in connection with the feelings of software developers.
The second things I realized is that when we went into discussions we got to three topics: feedback, reasoning about code and basic inference. These are three elements that I can think about and structure the code better based on these principles. Feedback is part of normal usability. Reasoning and inference is specific to code. At least these two become two principles of usable software design, on top of the old ones. This was very useful to me, because without knowing we eded up to this. If we stop here, for me this is perfect, we don't need to go more into this. 
Tomorrow we can do more code: pick existing code and see how we can make it more usable, or just start writing code on the ideas that we generated. Let's pick one of those two for tomorrow.

Adi: We found navigation smells. Let's create a writing group and write articles. The navigation smells are related to the feedback group. It's weird to explain to people that usable design also means good navigation through code, I want to write about this to better explain this. We did a code review on nUnit and we were surprised at the amount of coding smells in the codebase. It might be a good idea just to inspect existing (open source) code bases and try to understand what is wrong about the navigation in there. I would like to have clear options as an improvement. It felt like not everyone was free to do what they wanted to do.
